# Books for travel

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). And I used [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling. The books results are from [Open Library Api](https://openlibrary.org/)

## User Story

Find a book related with your travel destination to read during traveling and know more about your destination.

## How to run the app

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
